# COGIP-app

This was a group project (made with [Charlotte](https://github.com/CharlotteMoureau) and [Samantha](https://github.com/Samantha-35)) carried out from the 05<sup>th</sup> to the 19<sup>th</sup> of April 2021 (including one week off) as part of the BeCode Li√®ge's Junior Web Developer programm. We were tasked to make an accounting website for the ~~very well known~~ [COGIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15fqMAO76S8) company. The database must include data relating to people, companies and invoices which should be related as folow:

- Company --- type
- Company --- invoice
- People --- invoice
- People --- company

The app itself must include a companies page, an invoices page, a contact page and a providers/clients page as well as details pages for all of these informations.
